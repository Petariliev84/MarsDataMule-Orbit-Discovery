# Gravity-Only Mars-Earth Cycler Baseline

## Description:
GMAT script simulating TRADITIONAL Mars-Earth cycler orbit
**WITHOUT Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP)**.

## Purpose:
Serves as the **baseline/control** to demonstrate the revolutionary
improvements achieved with SRP optimization:

## Scientific Significance:
1. **Proof of SRP enhancement** - Shows what happens WITHOUT SRP
2. **Performance benchmark** - Quantifies the 2-60× improvements
3. **Educational value** - Teaches traditional vs advanced cycler design
4. **Verification** - Enables independent reproduction of baseline
